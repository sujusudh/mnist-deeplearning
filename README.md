Goal is to take an input image (28x28 pixels) of a handwritten single digit (0â€“9) and classify the image as the appropriate digit from mnist dataset.


Different stages involve:


Downloading the dataset having 60000 training and 10000 tesing data

Visualising the training image

Knowing the shape of dataset 


Preprocessing:

Reshaping images

Normalising the images


Build the Model:

Building the CNN models and layers

Compile and Fit the model


Evaluate the model:

We get the output corresponding to the image input with maximum accuracy
